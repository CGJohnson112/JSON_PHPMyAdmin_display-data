# JSON_PHPMyAdmin_display-data
converts table data to JSON data 
Okay, so you will need to construct a database and a table on your server in phpmyadmin. DB is called 'tutorials', table is 'products'.
You can enter any data you like without declaring them in the PHP file, since the fetch_assoc loop will get data from a simple array. Once the data in the database is updated and the website is refreshed on your browser, the data.json file will update.
